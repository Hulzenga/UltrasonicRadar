#repo contents
This repo contains two folders:

>├ UltrasonicRadar
>├ UltrasonicRadar Sketch

"UltrasonicRadar" contains the Eclipse project for the Android interface app and "UltrasonicRadar sketch" contains the arduino sketch loaded onboard of the radar.

#performance

#comments
This project was never done with the intent of making the code public and was done solely for educational purposes. The code is written by adding features ontop of another without any initial design or documentation. This repo then is made public solely for the educational purposes of others and to provide some guidance for people who want to write and Arduino+Android sketch/app.
